Hi there 👋, Greetings from Benmerabet Ayoub

I'm a Front-End Developer. I describe myself as a passionate developer who loves coding, open source, and the web platform ❤️.

I like to create and contribute to open source projects. That helps me to learn a ton of new stuff, grow as a developer and support other open source projects. My preferred weapons of choice: 👇
 
    NextJS / ReactJS
    Redux Toolkit
    CSS / Sass / material ui
    Html / JavaScript
